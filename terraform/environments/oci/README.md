OCI environment

Place OCI provider configuration and environment-specific tfvars in this folder. Keep secrets out of the repository and prefer environment variables or your CI's secret storage for provider credentials.

Example provider and tfvars are in this folder as `.example` files — copy and fill them for your environment.
