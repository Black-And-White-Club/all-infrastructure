    This file was originally a SealedSecret. The repository owner requested to avoid adding sealed
    credentials to the repository until later. If you need to add the sealed secret, create it in
    argocd under the `frolf-bot` namespace and seal it with `kubeseal` before committing the sealed YAML.
